## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive webpage where a user could view compiled information on recent UFO sightings. The webpage includes a UFO article title as well as a compelling snipit from the article. In addition, the webpage includes a table of UFO data and filtering options that allow the user to select specific UFO sighting details and tailor the table to these specifications. 

## Results

The main purpose of this webpage is to show UFO data in an easy to understand way. A table was created using HTML and JS to easily highlight a few details regarding each UFO sighting. There is a lot of UFO sighting data so the table is rather long. So, filtering options were created so the user could filter the table based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Below is what the table and filtering options look like on the webpage.

If the user wanted to filter the table, they simply type into one (or multiple) of the filter boxes and press enter. The table will automatically update to include only UFO sightings that match these filters. Below shows if you search by city name of "Benton". The table only displays cities named Benton.
