## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive webpage where a user could view compiled information on recent UFO sightings. The webpage includes a UFO article title as well as a compelling snipit from the article. In addition, the webpage includes a table of UFO data and filtering options that allow the user to select specific UFO sighting details and tailor the table to these specifications. 

## Results

The main purpose of this webpage is to show UFO data in an easy to understand way. A table was created using HTML and JS to easily highlight a few details regarding each UFO sighting. There is a lot of UFO sighting data so the table is rather long. So, filtering options were created so the user could filter the table based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Below is what the table and filtering options look like on the webpage.

If the user wanted to filter the table, they simply type into one (or multiple) of the filter boxes and press enter. The table will automatically update to include only UFO sightings that match these filters. Below shows if you search by city name of "Benton". The table only displays cities named Benton.

## Summary 

This webpage serves its purpose of offering an interactive page full of UFO information. However, there is always room for improvement and future steps for the direction of the webpage.

One drawback of the webpage is the filters are not setup well for error handling. The user has to type in the exact phrase into the box in order for the filter to work. In the image above, I typed in "Benton" and the table was filtered. However, if I mispelled it or didn't type the full name, such as "Bent", the filter would not work as intended.

The future direction of the website should start by addressing this drawback. Once completed, the website could include images from each of the sightings. As much as the information is helpful, if there was an image of each sighting that would make the webpage way more interesting. Another recommendation for further development is adding additional tabs to the webpage. These tabs could innclude different information, or even videos to recent UFO sightings. Adding more tabs to this page could help make this webpage a "one stop shop" for any and all UFO sighting information.
